# Advent of Code solutions in Groovy
Can be run via gradle (slower but prettier):   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`gradlew run --args="<year> <day>"`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If "day" equals "all", all 25 days will be ran.  
Or via groovy (faster but no formatting, needs groovy installed):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`groovy com\epakesko\advent\of\code\MainGroovy.groovy <year> <day> <type>` (from src\main\groovy folder)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All" is not an option here, type can be test, test1, test2, run, run1 or run2. Test and Run executes their rescpective 1 and 2 methods. Test is not available in some of the years.
